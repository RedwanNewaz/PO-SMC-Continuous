% UQ_THESIS.STY	Primary style for U.Q. Ph.D. Thesis by
%               Chris S. Craddock
%               Modified version of cit_thesis.sty by
%               Michael H. Kelsey
%
% USAGE:  (LaTeX 2.09) \documentstyle[draftfoot,preprint]{cit_thesis}
%         (LaTeX2e)    \documentclass[draftfoot,preprint]{cit_thesis}
%
% Modifies the {report} style, so that the title page and chapters
% are handled according to the Caltech Regulations for Format and
% Presentation of Theses (Office of Graduate Studies), and K. Turabian,
% _A Manual for Writers_ (U. Chicago Press, Chicago, 1987).
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The secondary style of [preprint] sets the conditional ``\ifpreprintsty''
% TRUE.  The command ``\preprint'', at the beginning of the document, has
% the same effect.  This causes a local publication number (see ``\pubnum''
% below) to be typeset in the upper right corner of the title page.  The author
% may also write conditional macros using the ``\ifpreprintsty''
% construction.
%
% For preliminary or working copies of the thesis, the secondary style of
% [draftfoot] may be used, or the command ``\draftfoot'' may be specified at
% the beginning of the document.  This produces a line at the bottom of every
% page, with ``DRAFT'' in the lower left corner, and the date and time when
% LaTeX was executed in the lower right.
% 
% A number of useful macros are defined for use in this style.  The
% title page of a thesis contains several standard phrases with possibly
% ``variable'' information, such as the degree to be awarded, the name
% and address of the institution, and copyright information.  The macros
% below are used to specify these data; the macro arguments indicate
% the default values as defined in this style file.
%
% \degreeaward{Doctor of Philosophy}			Degree to be awarded
% \university{University of Queensland}			Institution name
% \address{Brisbane, Australia}				Institution address
% \copyyear{\the\year}					Year of diploma award
%
% \pubnum{}					Publication/preprint number
%
% The usual LaTeX macros ``\author,'' ``\title,'' and ``\date'' work as
% defined in the LaTeX manual.  The argument to \date should be the date
% on which the candidate's final examination (defense) is scheduled.
%
% The publication/preprint number will be typeset in the upper right corner
% of the title page if and only if the [preprint] style is selected, or if
% the ``\preprint'' command was executed before \maketitle.
%
% The command ``\maketitle'' will generate a title page formatted according
% to the Caltech instructions, and including all of the information defined
% by the macros above.  Unlike the standard version, ``\maketitle'' may be
% repeated several times in a document:  the terms defined for it are _not_
% reset after the page is formatted.
%
% The command ``\extrachapter'' will generate an unnumbered chapter heading,
% similar to the LaTeX ``\chapter*'' command.  In addition, ``\extrachapter''
% will produce an entry in the Table of Contents.  This command is used in
% the {abstract} and {acknowledgements} environments, listed below.
%
% The initial portion of the thesis document, typically the copyright page,
% abstract, and tables of contents, figures, and tables, are numbered in
% roman numerals, while the body of the thesis is numbered in arabic.  The
% {frontmatter} environment handles these page numbering conventions.  The
% author should place
%
%	\begin{frontmatter}
%	...(abstract, contents, etc.)
%	\end{frontmatter}
%
% immediately following the \maketitle command.  The first entry in the
% {frontmatter} environment should generally be ``\makecopyright.''  This
% command generates a spearate copyright page, with the text
%
%				 (C) \copyyear
%				    \author
%			      All Rights Reserved
%
% centered at the bottom of the page.  Obviously, the items indicated with
% macro commands above are filled in with the actual arguments to those
% commands.
%
% The abstract is produced with the {abstract} environment, which generates
% an unnumbered chapter with an entry in the table of contents.  The author
% should use
%
%	\begin{abstract}
%	...(body of abstract goes here)
%	\end{abstract}
%
% within the {frontmatter} environment.
%
% An acknowledgements page is produced in the same way as the abstract, with
% the {acknowledgements} environment.
