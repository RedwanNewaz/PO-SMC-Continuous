\section{Are You Sitting Comfortably}

Up to this stage the majority of the work was concerned with somewhat generalised control allocation solutions. The methods examined all appear to provide a suitable and somewhat elegant solution to the problem, each exhibiting unique properties and design constants. As for the DEMON vehicle its self, the simulation results, see section \ref{ControlA}, indicates that the it copes well with the augment system, only slightly varying in control authority, to which can be deemed negligible.
