\chapter{Introduction}

Our goal is to enable the research community at large to be able to use FIRM in their own research (simulations/physical experiments).
For this purpose, we have developed an open source implementation of FIRM using OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library).

\section{Open Motion Planning Library}

As stated on the OMPL \url{http://ompl.kavrakilab.org}, \textit{OMPL, the Open Motion Planning Library, consists of many state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planning algorithms. OMPL itself does not contain any code related to, e.g., collision checking or visualization. This is a deliberate design choice, so that OMPL is not tied to a particular collision checker or visualization front end.}
\section{Aim}

To integrate FIRM with Open Motion Planning Library and use with ROS for physical and simulation experiments.

\section{Planned Tasks}

\subsection{Stage 1}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Implement the underlying graph structure using Boost
 \item Implement Edge weight class for OMPL
 \item Derive from OMPLâ€™s planner class to implement FIRM planner
 \item Implement the Belief Space by deriving from OMPL Compound State Space
 \item Implement Belief (State) class deriving from OMPL State
 \item Using OMPLs sampler class, develop a uniform random belief space sampler
 \item Implement observation model (monocular camera with image markers)
 \item Implement motion model
 \item Implement Controller class (integrate filters)
 \item Integrate DP with Planner
 \item Complete component integration and test in simulation (PMPL simulator)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Stage 2}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Integrate with ROS and test in simulation
 \item Benchmark with PMPL
 \item Test on physical system
\end{itemize}
