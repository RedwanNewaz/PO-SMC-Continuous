This report details the software architecture and progress of the development of an open source C++
implementation of FIRM integrated with OMPL. Our goal is to enable the robotics research community
to be able to freely use FIRM as part of their work. We plan to use the Robot Operating System (ROS) developed
by Willow Garage to conduct physical as well as simulation experiments.
