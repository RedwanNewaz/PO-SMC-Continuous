Brief
----------------------------------------
This application is an implementation of Feedback Information Road Maps (FIRM) with OMPL.

"FIRM is a multi-query approach for planning under uncertainty which is a belief-space variant of probabilistic roadmap

Compilation
----------------------------------------
The application is shared as a codeblocks project. You can use codeblocks to
directly compile the application. For ease of use, two code::blocks projects are provided for OSX and Linux (tested on Ubuntu), 
be sure to link to the correct libraries and set the include paths for your compiler build settings.

External Depencies: [All of these are hard requirements for this app to run]

1. Open Motion Planning Library: Excellent instructions provided on the ompl website for installation. Follow the instructions to build
and install the full omplapp and QT will automatically be installed as part of that. 
 
2. QT & OpenGL (freeglut): For Visualization

3. Armadillo C++ Matrix Algebra Library: Recommended to download and build from source

4. tinyxml: Needed for reading landmark/setup parameters


How to Use FIRM
---------------------------------------
We have developed FIRM as a planner based on the design philosophy of the planner class in OMPL. On top of the base FIRM planner,
we have added additional functionaility to the package such as a motion model class, observation model class, filter class etc. 
that are required within FIRM and not provided explicity in OMPL.

1. Use the provided application as is: Simply compile the code and run it. By changing the names of the setup paramter file (xml files)
to use in main.cpp, you can control the motion/observation model parameters, environment geometry file, robot geometry file, landmark
locations etc. 

2. Build you own application by calling FIRM in your scenario.
